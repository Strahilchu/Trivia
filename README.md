# Trivia

Stick to the format provided

IF YOU ADD APOSTROPHE ADD TWO '' INSTEAD OF ONE (only one will appear in-game, but in the config two are needed).

Its okay to delete questions, the numbers don't have to be in order.

Capitalization does not matter.

It doesn't hurt to add multiple answers for a question.

You can also add your own questions, I recommend adding them at the very end of the list and make sure the numbering is correct there so there is no duplicates
